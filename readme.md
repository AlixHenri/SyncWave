# SyncWave
This is a simple mobile APP made using the Android Studio ID as a college project for the Mobile Programming class.

## Introduction
SyncWave is a android APP which contains some guitar pedals and their information so you can learn and decide which one you will buy next for your guitar rig. Users of this APP will also be able to add their own pedals into the library and save pedals pages to see later on.

## Components that will be added
- [ ] Cards 
- [ ] Lateral menu 
- [ ] Horizontal Menu 
- [ ] Table Model

## Future Modifications
After finishing this APP for the Mobile Programming class the tool used for development of this application will change from Android Studio to React Native, since the project team find this framework to be less "painful", more productive and easier to use than the Android Studio.
